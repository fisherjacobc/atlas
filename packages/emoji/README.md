# @atlasbot/emoji

Utilities for dealing with emojis. The emojis list is pulled straight from Discord so there is never mismatches. Supports custom emojis, animated emojis, and unicode emojis. To be honest, I have no clue how emojis work, they're painful magic. This library is trying to make them less painful.
